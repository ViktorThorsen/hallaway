To set up the database properly, you can import mockdata from the files present in the hallaway folder in the following order:
SQLcommando.txt (run the script in sql)
addon.csv
address.csv
admin.csv
person.csv
hotel.csv
room.csv
addon_x_hotel.csv
address

If done properly, there shouldn't be any problems with running the script from "insert_mock_order_sql.txt". The file contains a script for inserting a 
order which can be used for testing the hallaway application.
